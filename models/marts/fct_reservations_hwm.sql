-- High Watermark incremental pattern demo.
--
-- Compare with the other incremental models in this project:
--   fct_reservation_events   → microbatch (dbt manages the window automatically)
--   fct_daily_court_stats    → delete+insert with MAX(col) FROM {{ this }}
--   fct_hourly_weather_usage → merge with MAX(col) FROM {{ this }}
--
-- The HWM pattern stores the exact upper bound used on each run in a central
-- watermark table. This means every processing window is mutually exclusive and
-- collectively exhaustive — unlike MAX(col) FROM {{ this }}, the upper bound is
-- captured before the model runs, not derived from what already landed in the
-- target table.
--
-- First run: no watermark exists, so get_previous_hwm() returns '1900-01-01'
-- and the model processes all rows (full refresh equivalent).
-- Subsequent runs: processes only rows strictly between the last committed
-- watermark and the current max snapshotted at run start.
